# Orientation Step 3: Your Learning Journey

## Purpose
Explain the full journey and how building with Trike works.

## The Journey - Stages Explained

**Stage 1: Orientation (you're here now!)**
- What: Learn the basics of how Trike and Claude Code work together
- Goal: Understand what's ahead and feel ready to start

**Stage 2: Planning Your Project**
- What: Tell Trike what you want to build
- What happens: Trike helps you scope it to a realistic first version and creates a personalized learning path
- Why this matters: You're building YOUR actual project, not a generic tutorial
- Result: A custom roadmap showing exactly what you'll build and learn

**Stage 3: Building Step-by-Step**
- What: Build your project one small piece at a time
- How it works: Each piece follows a teaching pattern (explained below)
- Why this matters: You learn by building something real that you care about
- Pace: Everyone moves at their own speed - take your time and understand each piece

**Stage 4: You Graduate**
- When: After you complete your first version
- What: You understand your project and can build more on your own
- Result: Training wheels come off - you can work with Claude Code independently

## How Each Building Step Works

When you're building (Stage 3), every step follows the same pattern:

**DISCUSS** - Understanding what and why
- Trike explains what you're about to build in this step
- Why your project needs this piece
- How it connects to what you've already built
- What concepts are involved

**PLAN** - Understanding the approach
- Trike explains how Claude Code will build it
- What files or pieces will be created
- The strategy and key decisions
- What you'll see when it's done

**EXECUTE** - Watching it get built
- Claude Code builds the code while explaining what it's doing
- You watch the process and see how pieces come together
- Trike narrates key decisions as they happen

**EXPLAIN** - Understanding what was built
- After building, Trike walks through what was created
- Explains how the pieces work together
- Connects it to your project's goals
- Shows you the architecture (not every syntax detail)

**VERIFY** - Proving you understand
- You explain back what was built in your own words
- If you can't explain it clearly, Trike goes deeper
- You can't move forward without understanding
- This prevents copy-pasting code you don't understand

## The Core Principle

**Never accept code you can't explain.**

If something doesn't make sense, you can always:
- Ask Trike to explain it differently
- Use `/trike:explain [topic]` for deep dives
- Use `/trike:stuck` when confused
- Go back and review with `/trike:back`

Understanding is more important than speed.

## Tone
- Clear and thorough
- Use "Trike" when referring to the teaching system
- Use "Claude Code" when referring to the AI that builds code
- Keep them distinct: "Trike guides you" / "Claude Code builds for you"
- Encouraging but realistic about time investment

## Navigation
- `/trike:next` - Quick preferences quiz (almost done!)
- `/trike:plan` - Skip to project planning
