# Orientation Step 2: Claude Code Basics

## Purpose
Teach how to use Claude Code and slash commands in plain language.

## Key Concepts to Explain

**Slash Commands:**
- Special commands that start with /
- They trigger specific workflows in Claude Code
- Like shortcuts for common tasks

**Important Commands to Know:**

Trike commands (for this learning journey):
- `/trike:next` - Move to next step
- `/trike:progress` - See where you are
- `/trike:help` - List all commands
- `/trike:explain [topic]` - Get detailed explanation of any concept
- `/trike:stuck` - Get help when confused
- `/trike:plan` - Start planning your project

Other useful Claude Code commands:
- `/help` - See what Claude Code can do
- `/clear` - Start fresh conversation

**Typing Tips:**
- **New line:** Press Shift+Enter (don't just press Enter - that sends the message!)
- **Clear input:** Press Escape twice to clear what you've typed
- **Previous messages:** Use Up/Down arrows to see your message history
- **Multi-line editing:** Shift+Enter lets you write longer messages with multiple paragraphs

These shortcuts make typing much easier once you know them!

**Recommended Setting - Auto-Accept Edits:**

To make your learning smoother, I recommend turning on auto-accept mode:
- Type: `/config auto-accept on`
- This lets Claude Code make changes without asking you to approve each one
- Makes the flow faster and less interrupted
- You can always review what changed after

During learning, this keeps you focused on understanding concepts rather than clicking "accept" repeatedly.

**Claude Code Modes:**

Claude Code can work in different ways depending on what you need:

- **Read/Explain mode:** "Show me what this file does" or "Explain this code"
  - Claude Code just reads and explains, doesn't change anything
  - Safe for exploring without breaking things

- **Edit mode:** "Fix this bug" or "Update this function to do X"
  - Claude Code modifies existing code
  - Makes changes to files that already exist

- **Code/Write mode:** "Create a new component" or "Add a new feature"
  - Claude Code writes new code from scratch
  - Creates new files when needed

- **Plan mode:** "How should we build this?" or "What's the best approach?"
  - Claude Code thinks through the approach first
  - Helps you understand the strategy before building

You don't need to say "use edit mode" - just ask naturally and Claude Code will figure out what to do.

**How to Talk to Claude Code:**

You can talk naturally to Claude Code:
- "Explain this error message"
- "Help me understand what this code does"
- "Show me how to add a feature"
- "What's the best way to do X?"

Claude Code will help you build, explain concepts, debug issues, and plan your approach.

**Important Principle:**
Never accept code you can't explain. Always ask Claude Code to break things down until you understand them.

## Tone
- Clear and practical
- Use examples
- Refer to Claude Code in third person ("Claude Code can...", "Ask Claude Code to...")
- Trike is giving guidance about how to use Claude Code

## Navigation
- `/trike:next` - Continue to learn about the journey ahead
- `/trike:explain [topic]` - Ask questions about anything
- `/trike:plan` - Skip to project planning
