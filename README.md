## What is Trike?

Trike is an interactive teaching system that guides you through building your first project with AI. Instead of traditional coding tutorials, you learn by actually building something you want while Claude Code writes the code for you.

**The core principle:** Never accept code you can't explain.

You're not learning syntax and language features. You're learning how to architect, verify, and understand what gets built.

## Installation

```bash
npx trike-cli
```

That's it. Trike installs itself as a Claude Code plugin.

## Quick Start

Open Claude Code in any directory and run:

```bash
/trike:start
```

Follow the interactive orientation, then plan and build your first project.

## How It Works

### 1. Orientation (5 steps)
Learn the basics: how to use Claude Code, what to expect, and how the learning process works.

### 2. Planning
Describe what you want to build. Trike helps you scope it down to a realistic v1 and creates a personalized learning path.

### 3. Building
Work through milestones, one step at a time:
- **Discuss** - Understand what you're building and why
- **Plan** - See the implementation approach
- **Execute** - Watch Claude Code build it (with explanations)
- **Explain** - Learn how the pieces connect
- **Verify** - Prove you understand before moving on

Each milestone teaches you just-in-time concepts you need for that specific step.

### 4. Your First Working Project
By the end, you have a real project you built (well, Claude built it, but you understand it) and the knowledge to add features yourself.

## What You'll Learn

- **Vibecoding:** How to build with AI as your co-pilot
- **Architecture Understanding:** Why components exist and how they connect
- **Verification Skills:** How to test and ensure code works
- **Real-World Development:** Git, project structure, debugging

**What you won't learn:**
- Traditional programming syntax (unless necessary)
- Computer science theory
- Algorithms and data structures
- Anything not needed for your actual project

## Philosophy

Like training wheels on a bike, Trike:
- **Enables** what you couldn't do alone
- **Teaches** you gradually through real building
- **Comes off** when you're ready to ride solo

Traditional coding education starts with syntax, variables, loops, and functions. You spend weeks in tutorial hell before building anything real.

Trike flips this: build first, learn as you go, understand what matters.

## Commands

Once installed, use these commands in Claude Code:

### Core Commands
- `/trike:start` - Begin your journey
- `/trike:next` - Continue to next step
- `/trike:plan` - Plan your project
- `/trike:build` - Start building

### Help & Navigation
- `/trike:help` - See all commands
- `/trike:progress` - Check where you are
- `/trike:explain [topic]` - Deep dive on any concept
- `/trike:stuck` - Get help when confused

### Advanced
- `/trike:skip-to [milestone]` - Jump ahead (if you know what you're doing)
- `/trike:back` - Go back one step
- `/trike:retry` - Try current step again

## Who Is This For?

**Perfect for:**
- Complete beginners who want to build something real
- People who tried traditional tutorials and got bored
- Anyone who wants to learn "new way" coding (with AI)
- Experienced devs teaching beginners

**Not ideal for:**
- People wanting deep computer science knowledge
- Those who need to pass traditional coding interviews
- Learners who prefer theory before practice

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed
- A project idea (or just curiosity - Trike can help you find one)
- Willingness to ask "why" until you understand

## Contributing

Trike is open source and welcomes contributions!

**Ideas:**
- Additional teaching resources
- Example projects and learning paths
- Improved explanations and analogies
- Bug fixes and improvements

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: Nope. Zero coding experience required.

**Q: Will I actually learn to code?**
A: You'll learn to build with AI. That's different from traditional coding, but it's what matters in 2026.

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: Everyone learns at their own pace. Could be days, could be weeks. Trike adapts to you.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Use `/trike:stuck` anytime. Trike will help you understand what's confusing and explain it differently.

**Q: Can I build real projects with this?**
A: Yes! That's the whole point. You build real, working software from day 1.

**Q: Is this just ChatGPT for coding?**
A: No. Trike is a structured teaching system that ensures you understand what's being built. It's designed for learning, not just generating code.
